        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>Welcome! I am a rising third-year Penn State student majoring in Management Information Systems and minoring in Information Sciences and Technology.

I am graciously employed by Penn State Campus Recreation as the Project Lead of the Creative Team. Here, I have learned transferable skills in marketing, team management, and project coordination. Each day I am excited to improve our content strategy through different metrics.

I am a passionate member of the Delta Phi Epsilon sorority, where I have serve as the Vice President of Academic Affairs. In addition to being a devoted sister, I am also an active member of Women in Business. As part of the contributions committee for Women in Business this past year, I grew genuine relationships with like-minded individuals while gaining local corporate sponsors for the annual Powerful Women Paving the Way conference.

In my spare time, you will find me learning classical flute literature, reading, or playing tennis.</p>
