        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a rising third-year Penn State student majoring in Management Information Systems and minoring in Information Sciences and Technology. This past summer, I had the opportunity to work with Easton Area Community Center as a web-development intern, growing my skillset in utilizing CMS software to write HTML and CSS. 
        
        During my time at Penn State, I have been a passionate sister of Delta Phi Epsilon sorority, serving as the VP of Academic Affairs. Within this role, I serve as the academic chair, social chair, and event planner. Another place I spend a significant amount of my time is Penn State Campus Rec, where I work as Project Lead for their Marketing division.
        
        Outside of my professional endeavors, you can find me shopping, playing tennis, learning classical flute literature, or skiing.</p>
