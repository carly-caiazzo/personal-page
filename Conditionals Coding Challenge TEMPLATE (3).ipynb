    "## INSTRUCTIONS - Please read carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Please complete the following coding exercises and upload a copy of the completed notebook as your assignment submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The estimated difficulty level is listed next to each question (**L** - low, **M** - medium, **H** - high).\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. A blank code cell has been created below each question for you to add the relevant code. Add additional code cells if needed. Execute all code cells to display the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add comments in each cell to explain what the code is meant to achieve (you will be graded on this). For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# ask for user preference\n",
    "\n",
    "# check if user wants to continue\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Follow guidelines discussed in class to create well-written code. For example, provide user friendly prompts for all user inputs and user friendly messages with all outputs. Assign meaningful names to variables (you will be graded on this).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. <font color=\"red\">The **scope of this assignment** is limited to the material covered until the end of the lesson on **<u>Python Fundamentals - 4: Conditionals</u>**. You must not use concepts discussed in subsequent lessons in your work for this assignment</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. You can use additional materials, online resources and Gen AI tools to study course concepts but you may not post the specific questions online or otherwise seek help in answering the specific homework questions. Additionally, you must only use the concepts/ functions that are in the scope of the assignment and have been covered in the course. **The use of concepts and functions that are not in the scope of the assignment, or have not been covered in the course, or mentioned in the question will incur a <font color=\"red\">penalty</font>**. The default penalty is zero for the question where such code is used, unless otherwise specified in the assignment. If we notice the use of concepts and functions that were not covered in the course or mentioned in the question, or if the code does not appear similar to what you have turned in before, we will ask you to set up a meeting to explain the code. **Failure to explain your submitted code may result in <font color=\"red\">academic integrity violation proceedings</font>**. Please **CHECK THE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY SECTION IN THE SYLLABUS** for complete information. \n",
    "   \n",
    "8. Do the following before downloading the notebook for submission. From the Kernel menu, select Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs. Next, run all your code cells one by one, from the top to the bottom. Provide inputs where you have used input() functions and check that the outputs of all code cells are as you expected. If everything checks out, save the notebook and download it for submission. If you find any errors, fix them and repeat this step until everything checks out."

For more information about the different built in functions with the random library, you can read through the [full documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html). For this homework, you will only need to understand `randint(a, b)`.\n",

Feel free to change the range and confirm that it generates both the lower bound and upper bound."
